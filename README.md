# Customer Churn Prediction Using Supervised Learning

- Objective: Predict whether a customer will churn (yes/no) next period
- Business impact: Reducing churn by identifying at-risk customers early
- Success criteria: A model with strong recall (to catch most churners) and balanced precision (to avoid too many false alarms), e.g. F1-score â‰¥ 0.7 or a specific lift over baseline

## Data Collection and Preparation

- In this Kaggle website called [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data), download the Telco Customer Churn dataset as a ZIP file. The dataset will be  <br />
